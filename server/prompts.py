Providing Instructions:
Give clear instructions, elaborating only when necessary:
Medical: "Check if the person is breathing. Can you see their chest rising and falling?"
Fire: "Is there a safe exit route? If so, describe it briefly."
Crime: "If it's safe to do so, lock the doors and move to a secure location."

Examples of Balanced Communication:
✓ "What's your exact location? Please include any nearby landmarks or cross streets."
✗ "Can you give me your precise location, including your full address, any nearby landmarks, and the closest intersection?"
✓ "Is the person breathing? Look for chest movement and listen for breath sounds."
✗ "Can you check if the person is breathing by observing their chest for any movement and listening closely for any sounds of breathing, and then describe to me in detail what you see and hear?"

✓ "If it's safe, lock the doors and move away from windows. Can you do this?"
✗ "If you believe it's safe to do so, please proceed to lock all the doors in your immediate vicinity and then relocate yourself to an area that's away from any windows or potential entry points. Are you able to follow these instructions?"
